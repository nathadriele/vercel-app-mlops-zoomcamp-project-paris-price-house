## MLOps Project: Property Price Forecast in Paris

### Overview
This project is developed as part of the MLOps Zoomcamp course by DataTalks.Club. It focuses on predicting house prices in the urban environment of Paris based on various features. The primary goal is to provide an accurate estimation of property prices using machine learning models, aiding potential buyers, real estate agents, and developers in making informed decisions.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of imaginary data on house prices in Paris. The attributes are all numeric and represent various features of the properties. This dataset is valuable for educational purposes, practice, and gaining knowledge in machine learning and data analysis.

### Attributes:
- `squareMeters`: Total area of the property in square meters.
- `numberOfRooms`: Total number of rooms in the property.
- `hasYard`: Indicates whether the property has a yard.
- `hasPool`: Indicates whether the property has a pool.
- `floors`: Number of floors in the property.
- `cityCode`: Zip code of the property location.
- `cityPartRange`: A range indicating the exclusivity of the neighborhood.
- `numPrevOwners`: Number of previous owners of the property.
- `made`: Year the property was built.
- `isNewBuilt`: Indicates if the property is newly built.
- `hasStormProtector`: Indicates if the property has storm protection.
- `basement`: Basement area in square meters.
- `attic`: Attic area in square meters.
- `garage`: Garage size in square meters.
- `hasStorageRoom`: Indicates if the property has a storage room.
- `hasGuestRoom`: Number of guest rooms in the property.
- `price`: Predicted price of the property.

### Deployment
The project is deployed on Vercel, making it easily accessible for users. The deployment ensures that users can input property details through the frontend and get real-time price predictions.

### How to Use
- 1. Fill in the Property Details: Enter the relevant details about the property in the input fields provided in the frontend interface.
- 2. Click "Estimate Price": Once all the fields are filled, click the "Estimate Price" button to get the predicted property price.
- 3. View the Results: The predicted price will be displayed on the screen, providing an estimate based on the input data.

### Importance of the Project
Predicting property prices accurately is crucial for various stakeholders in the real estate market. This project leverages machine learning to provide reliable price estimates, which can help:

- Buyers: Make informed decisions about purchasing properties.
- Real Estate Agents: Provide accurate price recommendations to clients.
- Developers: Evaluate potential investments and project profitability.
By using this project, users can gain insights into property pricing trends in Paris and make better financial decisions.

This project serves as an excellent example of applying MLOps principles to a real-world problem, demonstrating the integration of data science, machine learning, and operational processes to deliver valuable insights and solutions.
